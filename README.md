# Loadcell-Cleaning-the-output

Typical loadcell applications requiring bridge amplification are invariably noisy, requiring some kind of noise reduction.

Here, a digital 4-pole low paass filter is described which adopts the 'Bessel' response having a maximally flat group delay performance achieving little or no overshoot.  Characteristic of this type of response is a slow descent into the stop band (a wide transition band), a useful trade-off for many loadcell applications.
